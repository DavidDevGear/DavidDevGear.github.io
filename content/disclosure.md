# Transparency & Disclosure

## Amazon Associates Program

Game Dev Gear Reviews is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.

**What this means:**
- When you click on Amazon links on this site and make a purchase, I may earn a small commission
- This comes at **no extra cost to you**
- Commissions help support the site and allow me to continue providing detailed reviews

## Review Integrity Promise

I believe in complete transparency. Here's my promise to you:

### ✅ I Will Always:
- Disclose affiliate relationships clearly
- Provide both pros AND cons for every product
- Show my research methodology
- Recommend alternatives at different price points
- Update reviews when products change or new information emerges

### ❌ I Will Never:
- Recommend products I don't believe in
- Hide negative aspects of products
- Accept payment for positive reviews
- Let affiliate relationships influence ratings

## My Review Methodology

Since I don't own every product I review, my analysis is based on:

1. **Aggregating 1000+ customer reviews** from Amazon and other sites
2. **Technical specification analysis** from manufacturer data
3. **Community consensus** from game dev forums (Reddit, Discord, etc.)
4. **Professional reviews** from trusted tech sites
5. **Price history tracking** to identify good deals

## How to Support the Site

1. **Use affiliate links** when making purchases (no cost to you)
2. **Share reviews** you find helpful with other developers
3. **Provide feedback** on my reviews via email or social media
4. **Consider my freelance services** for Godot development
